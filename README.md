# Notepad-Text-Editor
A console-based text editor similar to notepad, with file saving/loading features

This program is a recreation of the notepad text editor in a console application. Functions of the text editor include the ability to add or delete characters, naviagte through the character using the arrow keys, and create a new line using the enter key.

Users can load files into the text editor and can edit them from the program, and they can also save their new or edited text documents to .txt files. 

The program uses an array of doubly- linked lists to hold character information. The array holds each line of characters, which are nodes of a linked list. The cursor holds a reference to a node to be added or deleted from.
